## Overview
Magic Maestro is a gesture-based music controller that transforms your hand movements into dynamic musical expression. Inspired by the ROLI Airwave and other gesture-controlled instruments, this DIY project uses computer vision and MIDI integration to control orchestral instruments in real-time. With just a camera and some Python modules, you can bring music to life like a true maestro conducting an orchestra in thin air.

## Features
- üéµ Real-Time Gesture Control: Adjust expression, volume, and dynamics seamlessly.
- üéπ MIDI Integration: Works with popular DAWs like Logic Pro X.
- üñêÔ∏è Hand Tracking: Leverages computer vision for intuitive, natural control.
- ‚ú® DIY and Open-Source: Build your own Magic Maestro with simple tools and code.


## How It Works
#### Hand Tracking:
Uses mediapipe to detect hand positions and track movements.

#### MIDI Mapping:
Maps gesture data to MIDI values and sends MIDI messages for
volume (CC #7) and expression (CC #11) to your DAW
to control orchestral instruments dynamically.


## Getting Started
#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A webcam or built-in camera
- MIDI-compatible DAW (e.g., Logic Pro X)
- Libraries:
- mediapipe (for hand tracking)
- rt-midi (for MIDI integration)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/magic-maestro.git
cd magic-maestro
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up your DAW to receive MIDI input.

## Usage
1. Run the script to start the hand-tracking system:
```bash
python magic_maestro.py
```

2. Position your hand in front of the camera and move it up and down to adjust intensity.

Follow on-screen instructions for controling the functionality.


# Potential Improvements / TODOs
- UI for configuring things
- Choose MIDI Channel
- Turn on/off individual effects  (expression, volume, modulation, etc)
- Performance improvements
- Binary installation app
